# Mycroft Mark II Hardware

*⛵️ Note that this repository is a work-in-progress. It will be updated and improved on over time.*

This repository contains all of the designs and technical details of the Mycroft Mark II Prototypes.

Each sub-directory represents a prototype device. Currently this consists of:
- [Mark II RPi OTS](./mark-II-rpi-ots) - the first Mark II prototype released in February 2020 made from off-the-shelf components.
- [Mark II RPi DevKit](./mark-II-Rpi-devkit) - the second iteration of the Mark II prototype. This includes a custom daughterboard (SJ201) that integrates the components from the OTS prototype into a single PCB.
